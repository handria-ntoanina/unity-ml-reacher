1-Random bootstrap
2-Dueling Network 
	S-->Network-->Output1
	Output1-->Network-->Value
	Output1+Action-->Network-->Advantage
	return Value + Advantage
3-Input Normalization
	Run random episodes
	Gather states
	Find Mu and Sigmoid
	Use Mu and Sigmoid to normalize all input during learning and testing process
